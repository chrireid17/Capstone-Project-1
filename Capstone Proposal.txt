Capstone One Proposal


My website will be designed to give bartenders full access to cocktail recipes. Users will be allowed to favorite recipes to easily view how to make their favorite cocktails. Users who visit my cite wil likely be in the service industry as front of house employees. I plan to use The CocktailDB api which uses json as the data type. My database schema will contain a basic user model and a cocktail model. On the cocktail model, columns like ‘drink name’ and ‘insructions’ will be present. One issue that I can foresee running into is allowing a user to favorite a cocktail. Now that I think of it, it may be best to have a separate data table designated to favorites. The only sensitive information to secure will be user password and maybe user email if that’s the way I choose to register users. My app’s functionality will be relatively basic. Allow users to search the api for specific cocktails and add them to a list of favorites if they wish to do that. Also may include the functionality of a ‘drink of the day’ displayed on the landing page. This would involve querying the api for a random drink and making it the designated drink of the day. User flow will be pretty simple. Anyone will be allowed to come to the website and search for drinks. However, if a user wants to add a drink to their favorites list they would then have to register an account. Beyond that, user flow is pretty simple. Search for drinks, favorite if you like it, return to that recipe if you need to see it again. The ability to favorite drinks and search for cocktails makes my site more than just CRUD.
