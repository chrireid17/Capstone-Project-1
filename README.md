### Description
The goal for this project was to create an application for users to easily find their favorite cocktails and instructions 
on how to make them. Additionally I wanted to emphasize my ability to create a functional application as well a user experience
that is straight forward and easy to use. 

### How to Install and Run
Install all dependencies in requirements.txt.
Run the seed file before running the application in order to properly seed the database.
