### Description
The goal for this project was to create an application for users to easily find their favorite cocktails and instructions 
on how to make them. Additionally I wanted to emphasize my ability to create a functional application as well a user experience
that is straight forward and easy to use. 

### Features
- Functional search bar which returns a pagination object to paginate search results.
- Ability for users to favorite cocktails and remove cocktails from favorites list.
- Complete login functionality.

### User Flow
- Any user, logged in or not, has the ability to use the search functionality of the site.
- Only logged in users are allowed to add drinks to a list of favorites.
- If a user is not logged in and attempts to 'favorite' a drink, they will be prompted to log in.

### How to Install and Run
Install all dependencies in requirements.txt.
Run the seed file before running the application in order to properly seed the database.
